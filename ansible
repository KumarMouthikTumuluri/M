installation ansible /controller /Master
Prerequisites for Ansible Engine/control Node:
RHEL/Centos /Debian/Ubuntu Linux with python 2(2.7) or python 3 (3.5 installed)
windows is not supported for control node

Note:Ansible version 2.4 and later can manage earlier operating systems that contain Python 2.6 or python

we can install ansible in 3 ways
 using yum 
 using pip
 using compile file
 
 open https://docs.ansible.com
 
 centos 
 cat /etc/redhat-release
 python --version
 yum install ansible
 
  rpm packages for EPEL
  
  
  yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum install ansible
ansible --version
cd /etc/ansible/
ls -lrt
ansible history


Steps to configure ansible
launch / select required no of servers. which are called Managed Nodes/clients
Required for Managed Nodes/Clients:
  >we require python 2(version 2.6 or later) or python (3.5or later)
  Note :we can also work without python on managed Nodes that is usung raw modules
 ansible uses ssh connection to connect  and work with Managed nodes 
 
 we create ssh connection in two ways
  pawssword authentication
  password less authentication (that is with ssh keys)
  provide or manage nodes ip/fqdn in inventory file n ansible engine
  simply test configuration by runnning :ansible all -m ping
  
  
  >>>>password less authentication
  :create same user (ansadmin)across all servers and provide password for all users
  useradd ansadmin
  passwd ansadmin
  ---new passwd :ansadmin@123
  same done for all users
 >>> provide root priviliges to all ansadmin users on all users
  visudo
  ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWORD:ALL
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config-password authentication - yes(Make sure your password authentication is yes all servers under /etc/ssh/sshd_config file)
  service sshd restart /systemctl restart sshd
 sudo su ansadmin
 cd 
 ls -a
 ssh-keygen
 =3 times+enter 
 ls -al
  cd .ssh/
  ls -lrt
  generate ssh-keys using ssh-keygen command from ansadmin 
  copy ssh public key using ssh-copy-id <hostname> from /home/ansadmin/.ssh/ location- ssh-copy-id 3.143.248.186 then yes then type ssh 3.143.248.186 you can able to login to that server agent 
  now login to your remote server without providing password with the following commmand
   >sshuser_name@hostname-ssh ansadmin@3.143.248.186
   update invertory file with ips
   cd /etc/ansible/
   ls
    vi hosts-paste ips
    ansible all -m ping
    
    
    the ansible inventory file defines the list of hosts upon which the ansible works
